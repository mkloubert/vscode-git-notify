## Install [[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)]

Launch VS Code Quick Open (`Ctrl + P`), paste the following command, and press enter:

```bash
ext install vscode-git-notify
```

Or search for things like `vscode-git-notify` in your editor.

## How to use [[&uarr;](#table-of-contents)]

### Settings [[&uarr;](#how-to-use-)]

Open (or create) your `settings.json` in your `.vscode` subfolder of your workspace.

Add a `deploy.reloaded` section and one or more "watchers":

```json
{
    "git.notify": {
    }
}
```

The following providers and events are supported:

| Event | [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) | [GitHub](https://github.com) | [Gitea](https://gitea.io) | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
| ---- |:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Closed issues | X | X | | X |
| Closed pull requests | X | X | X | X |
| New commit / push | | X | X | |
| New issues | X | X | | X |
| New issue comments | X | X | | X |
| New pull requests | X | X | X | X |
| Re-opened issues | X | X | | X |
| Re-opened pull requests | | X | X | X |

#### Bitbucket [[&uarr;](#settings-)]

First you have to create a webhook for your repository.

Click on the `Settings` on the left side, then on `Add webhook` button in `Webhooks`:

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/bitbucket_webhooks_1.png">
</kbd>

Setup the URL, that should be called for an event. This URL must be able to redirect to your machine, where your VS Code instance runs. For that, you should check your firewall settings.

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/bitbucket_webhooks_2.png">
</kbd>

```json
{
    "git.notify": {
        "watchers": {
            "23979": [
                {
                    "provider": "bitbucket"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

This will open a HTTP server instance on your machine on port `23979` on startup.

#### GitHub [[&uarr;](#settings-)]

First you have to create a webhook for your repository.

Click on the `Settings` tab and select `Webhooks` on the left side:

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/github_webhooks_1.png">
</kbd>

Click on `Add webhook` button:

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/github_webhooks_2.png">
</kbd>

Setup the URL, that should be called for an event. This URL must be able to redirect to your machine, where your VS Code instance runs. For that, you should check your firewall settings.

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/github_webhooks_3.png">
</kbd>

Now, you can define a watcher in your settings (it is recommended to do this globally - `CTRL + ,` / `CMD + ,`):

```json
{
    "git.notify": {
        "watchers": {
            "80": [
                {
                    "secret": "Test123"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

This will open a HTTP server instance on your machine on port `80` on startup, by using `Test123` as secret expression as defined in the webhooks settings.

#### Gitea [[&uarr;](#settings-)]

First you have to create a webhook for your repository.

Click on the `Settings` tab, select `Webhooks` sub-tab and click on `Add Webhook / Gitea`:

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/gitea_webhooks_1.png">
</kbd>

Setup the URL, that should be called for an event. This URL must be able to redirect to your machine, where your VS Code instance runs. For that, you should check your firewall settings.

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/gitea_webhooks_2.png">
</kbd>

Now, you can define a watcher in your settings (it is recommended to do this globally - `CTRL + ,` / `CMD + ,`):

```json
{
    "git.notify": {
        "watchers": {
            "8080": [
                {
                    "provider": "gitea",

                    "secret": "Test123"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

This will open a HTTP server instance on your machine on port `8080` on startup, by using `Test123` as secret expression as defined in the webhooks settings.

#### GitLab [[&uarr;](#settings-)]

First you have to create a webhook for your repository.

Click on the `Settings` on the left side and click on `Integrations`:

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/gitlab_webhooks_1.png">
</kbd>

Setup the URL, that should be called for an event. This URL must be able to redirect to your machine, where your VS Code instance runs. For that, you should check your firewall settings.

<kbd>
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mkloubert/vscode-git-notify/master/img/gitlab_webhooks_2.png">
</kbd>

```json
{
    "git.notify": {
        "watchers": {
            "5979": [
                {
                    "provider": "gitlab",

                    "secret": "Test123"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

This will open a HTTP server instance on your machine on port `5979` on startup, by using `Test123` as secret expression as defined in the webhooks settings.

#### Secure HTTP [[&uarr;](#settings-)]

It is highly recommended, to setup secure HTTPS instead of plain HTTP:

```json
{
    "git.notify": {
        "watchers": {
            "443": [
                {
                    "secure": true,

                    "ca": "/path/to/ssl/fullchain.pem",
                    "cert": "/path/to/ssl/cert.pem",
                    "key": "/path/to/ssl/privkey.pem",

                    "secret": "Test 1 2 3"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

You can also use relative paths for the SSL files, of course. Those paths are tried to be mapped in the following order:

* `${HOME_DIR}/.ssl`
* `${WORKSPACE}/.vscode` (works also with [multi workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces))

If you use a self-signed certificate, you should disable SSL verification in your git provider / hoster.

In GitHub, e.g., you have to click on `Disable SSL verification` button, when adding a web hook:
